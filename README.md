## Introduction

The **Sign-Language Motion Recognition and Translation for Videos** project aims to develop an application that can recognize sign language gestures in real-time from video streams and translate them into spoken or written language. By using deep learning techniques, the system can accurately identify different gestures and map them to corresponding words or phrases, thus aiding communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features

- Real-time sign language gesture recognition from video streams.
- Translation of recognized gestures into text and speech.
- Support for multiple sign languages.
- High accuracy and performance with deep learning models.
- User-friendly interface for ease of use.
